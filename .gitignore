#Why GIT IGNORE IS USED.

#IF we do not want to add some files in github we can place it here, so by defualt it will
#not add in guthub.

#node_modules is directory which is generated by using npm install.
#we do not want it in git as we can install it everytime we are pulling the code.

#if we will run npm intall then by defualt it will go in package.json and look for all the npm
#we had used and will automatically install them.

#use git status and see what all directory is added in git. We will see node_modules will not come
#as we have mentioned it in gitignore.
