To run this project go to root directory.
i.e /webs-erver and give 'npm run dev'.

It is running using npm run dev as in package.json we have added two additionla tags.
One is START: It is for heroku to look the path from where to start the application.
Second is dev: in that we have given the nodemon command that we were using earlier. So
we have created kind of alias and running the application using npm run dev.

Note: If we will try to run using nodemon src/app.js we will see an error. It is because
nodemon should be installed globally to run that command. But for dev nodemon should be present
locally so we have installed it locally and created the alias.
